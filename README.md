Color Blindness Filter - Prototype

Overview
This is a prototype for a Chrome extension that helps color-blind users by applying real-time color adjustments to webpages. The extension provides a simple popup UI where users can choose from different filters designed for various types of color blindness.


Current Status
This is an early-stage prototype and not yet optimized for full user customization.
Currently supports basic CSS-based color adjustments on webpages.
No user preferences are saved—filters reset when the page reloads.
Not yet published on the Chrome Web Store.

How It Works
The user selects a color blindness type from the popup menu.
The extension modifies the colors on the current webpage.
It uses CSS filters to enhance color contrast for better visibility.
Supported Color Blindness Types
Protanopia (Red-Blind)
Deuteranopia (Green-Blind)
Tritanopia (Blue-Blind)
Achromatopsia (Total Color Blindness)

Installation (For Testing Only)
Download the project files to your computer.

The extension will now appear in the Chrome toolbar.
How to Use
Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
Select a color blindness filter from the dropdown menu.
Click Apply, and the colors on the webpage will adjust.
